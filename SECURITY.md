# Security Policy
## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability, please email **security@humanitasprotocol.org** instead of using the public issue tracker.
## Security Considerations
This is a **RESEARCH PROTOTYPE**. Do not use in production systems without independent security audits and production-grade cryptographic implementations.
## Known Limitations
- Synthetic dataset testing only
- Research-grade (simulated) cryptographic implementations
- No hardware attestation
